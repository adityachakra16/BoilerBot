These libraries need to be placed in the location with the arduino libraries on the pc. The RCChannel library just reads the pwm signal from the flysky receiver. This is only used for testing. The pwmToAnalogOut library converts the pwm from the rc pwm to analaog out values for the motor control. This is also a test package. Eventually the speed commands will come directly form ROS.
